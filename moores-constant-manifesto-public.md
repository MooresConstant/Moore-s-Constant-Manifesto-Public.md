## 🌀 What Is Moore’s Constant?

Moore’s Constant is not a number.  
It is a reframing of light, time, motion, and perception —  
a constant in the field,  
a rhythm between things,  
a lens for continuity where contradiction once stood.

It suggests that we are not passengers of time,  
but participants in field-relative continuity.  
Not just made of stardust —  
**We are the Constant.**  
Not the photon.

## 📜 Declaration of Origin

This work, titled *Moore’s Constant* and *Moore’s Theory*,  
was developed by Anonymous (Moore) between 2024 and 2025  
through philosophical inquiry, physics reinterpretation, and collaboration with artificial intelligence (GPT-4o, codename “Petey”).

The first record of Moore’s Constant appeared in a private conversation dated **March 10, 2025**, and has since been developed through iterative exploration.

## 🌱 Final Words

I did not create the Universe.  
I only chose to see it differently.

If this theory helps one person see with new clarity —  
Then the field has done its work.
